# Game Staff Ranks

## Trial Game Administrator
Trial Game Administrators are accepted applicants learning the ropes. They utilize only the most basic of administrative tools and are not permitted to greatly alter the flow of rounds or grant special requests. 

## (Full) Game Administrator
Trial Game Administrators are promoted to a Full Game Administrator once a Senior Admin deems they are ready. Full Admins are given more permissions and allowed more freedom in what they can do. Full admins are expected to try and keep rounds engaging without making the station a constantly chaotic place. Full admins are also strongly encouraged to act IC as members of Central Command, issuing reports and guiding the round as the watchful eye.

## Senior Game Administrator
Senior Game Administrators are selected by the Head Admins to advise and train other admins as well as assisting in day-to-day operations.

## Head Game Administrator
Head Game Administrators are responsible for the whole of the admin team and relating rules/policy.

# Game Adminstrator Policy and Conduct

## General Conduct and Policies

### General Behavior

-   Maintain a decent standard of professionalism when operating within the community. Insulting, harassing, or intentionally targeting anyone in our community is not tolerated.
-   If you are being insulted or harassed, don’t provoke or retort their behavior as it will only escalate hostility.
-   Do not spam ping members of the community or staff.
-   Game Administrators are held to a higher standard than normal players.
-   Breaches of conduct by Administrators may result in elevated punishments, including but not limited to immediate dismissal.

### Playing the game
- When in-game as an antagonist, head of staff, member of Security, or as a silicon (excluding pAI and Drone), you are required to de-admin.
- If you are the only admin on, do not go into the round without checking if another admin can take your place.
- If you are currently handling any administrative issues, do not accept antagonist roles that are polled to ghosts.
- Inform the other staff online if you are going to de-admin in order to play. This rule is simple common courtesy to keep the admin team informed and coordinated.

### Impartiality and transparency
-   Administrative actions are to be carried out within admin channels. Any and all private communications while acting as an admin are to be documented and provided within admin channels.
-   While you have the discretion to make decisions outside of the rules, you may not simply bypass rules you disagree with. Use your discretion wisely during unusual circumstances.
-   Do not resolve Admin-helps or reports about you.
-   Do not handle issues involving your character in-game without explicit approval by a Senior admin. (Exceptions will be made for players blatantly griefing the server)
-   Any form of bias in dealing with players is not tolerated, favoritism from players or other staff should not weigh in the decision making process.

### Admin-Help Conduct
-   Handle Admin-helps respectfully, do not be condescending or aggressive in Admin-helps.
-   Players which violate Admin-help conduct should be at minimum noted and told to stop.
-   This applies even if the issue is valid and you choose to investigate the report; do not enable rude players to mistreat other admins even if you can take it.
-   Particularly egregious violations of player Admin-help conduct should be met with proper handling based on how many times in the past this has been an issue.
-   Admins which are not in Stealth should be prepared to drop what they're doing and accept tickets immediately.
-   If you are playing in the round and did not set yourself to Deadmin or Stealth, this means you are duty-bound to go SSD at a moment's notice regardless of what may be happening in front of you.
-   Admins dodging Admin-helps immediately after they have been submitted may be subject to disciplinary action unless a replacement admin is sought.
-   Admins should notify players that have sent a Admin-help when their issue is being investigated.
-   Players are not entitled to know the outcome of any individual ticket, and admins are not required to share the outcome.
-   Players should not be informed of punishments not issued to them.
-   Do not intercept another admins ticket without asking them first, if you need to correct them or change their ruling the admin channel or PM the working admin instead.
-   If an Admin-help becomes too complex or another issue prevents you from resolving it inform the other admins through the admin channel and provide the player you were handling.

## Taking action within a round
- IC and OOC punishments are separate. That a player has suffered IC consequences (anything that is over when the round restarts) should have no bearing on OOC punishments (bans and notes) if the player has broken rules.
- Admins are to cite broken rules within the Admin-help, and any resulting bans or notes. Cite rule 1 if you are acting outside of the rules but in the best interest of the game.

### IC Punishments (Admin Intervention)
- Players which are brought to the attention of Central Command (whether through ahelp or official IC contact) may be subject to IC intervention in cases where it would be more organic to the round flow. Sometimes it's better to hold off on the bwoink and let things play out for the benefit of the round at large. Explaining where a player has messed up can cause their character to dramatically and unnaturally change their behavior.
- CentCom announcements are a great way to convey information to players about ongoing events, prefacing/warning about admin intervention, or to add flavor to the round. Announcements should remain IC at all times and should not be used for OOC communications.
- The Head of Security may be contacted and instructed to restrain and strip the rank from other heads of staff which have proven to be disloyal to Nanotrasen
- In cases where a more subtle touch is necessary, Nanotrasen may contact certain agents and empower them as an Internal Affairs Agent. If the chosen agent is caught, Nanotrasen will disavow them and claim to have no connections. 

  - **Be sure to use a "Custom" antagonist to do this.
  
- Nanotrasen is occasionally known to employ the spider clan ninjas to "clean up" particularly messy situations, such as when station security has been found to be compromised and aiding the enemies of Nanotrasen.
- In the case of antagonists acting out of line, any of the situations above may be relatively easily reversed as well - being disowned by the Syndicate is quite a dangerous thing after all.
- Smites are also a way to punish minor IC misbehavior or rule breaks, and are especially good as a punishment for cursing the gods, or otherwise abhorrent behavior in prayers.

Some questions you should ask yourself before smiting a player are:
- **Did the player(s) involved pray or otherwise do something to incur the wrath of an established divine being IC?**
- **Did the player(s) involved break the rules in some way?**
- **Is this an attempt to enhance the round for players at all?**

  - CentCom Response Teams may be used to help enhance on-going rounds, bring rounds to a close, or add flavor to IC events
  

### IC Responses

#### Joke/Weak Responses
Sent to bring life back to the station. These are true powerhouses used in the most dire of situations.

- Clown
- ERT Janitor


#### Low Severity
Sent to address low risk issues with the station that would normally require a CentCom response, such as reprimanding a misbehaving captain.

- CentCom Officials

#### Normal Severity
Sent to address moderately dangerous incidents that cannot be addressed by current station-staff. For example, instances where most of the security detail has been killed and the station requests aid.

These Teams should only be dispatched after the station officially requests aid (or contact with an official is lost) and only if the station is is at a reasonable disadvantage against a threat.

- Emergency Response Team

- CBURN

#### High Severity
Sent to exterminate all life on the station address extremely dangerous incidents on the station and mutinies against Central Command.

These teams should only be dispatched in extreme cases where round-ending adminbus is called for.

Normal antagonists should generally not face these unless taunting Central Command, and normal players should only face them in cases of full-blown mutiny.

- Deathsquad

#### Notes
- Notes are a form of record, not a punishment. Notes should be issued to document any incidents of breaking rules that did not result in bans.
- Read the notes to determine if they’re relevant to the player’s current misconduct.
- When writing notes, describe the misconduct and how the player responded. Be sure to include the rules broken, how cooperative the player was in the ticket, and any information or warnings given to the player.
- All notes involving rule breaks should be visible to the player. Secret notes should only be utilized for unconfirmed issues or to document suspicious occurrences which are not rule breaks.
- Do not show a player someone else's notes, be it through Discord or in-game means. If they want to share it, they can do so by themself.
- Notes can only be appealed if the note is invalid AND it has been less than three months since it was applied. This does not include wrongfully applied ban-notes as those should have had their record already deleted as written their notes tab.

## Special Conduct and Policies

### Creation of additional Antagonists
- Mid-round antagonists should only be added when it is sensible to make the round more interesting (usually when existing antags are dead or ineffective)
- Mid-round antagonists should almost always be randomly selected.
- Admins manipulating antagonist spawning may not take the antagonist roles they have influenced or created.

### Ending rounds
Rounds should be allowed to conclude naturally under most circumstances. However, rounds that go on for too long or have substantial issues may be pushed towards their natural end artificially under these guidelines.

#### When to encourage a round to end
- Rounds that exceed 90-minutes that have no clear end in sight
- Issues with the server that negatively impact game performance and/or player experience
- To accommodate a scheduled admin event
- To accommodate important security/bug fixes (At a maintainer's discretion)
- To accommodate potentially unstable/important test merges (At a maintainer's discretion)

#### How to encourage a round to end
- Coercing command staff to complete station objectives or to evacuate through roleplay means (Sending a CC official, secret announcements, etc.)
- Triggering minor "random" events and creating mid-round antagonists to help encourage an evacuation
- Triggering severe "random" events and/or creating failures within established station infrastructure (Such as disabling telecommunications)
- If all else fails, total station destruction and/or round-ending antagonists (Lone Operatives are preferable) may be spawned.

## Event protocol
- Admin Events are large-scale modifications to the round that would dramatically affect the typical flow of the game. When doing an admin event, you must do the following:

- Before the event even begins a player vote must be held (OOC Tab) with a majority in favor of participating in the event.
  - The vote should not specify the details of the event, only that one is to be held.
    
- An admin announcement must be made explaining that an admin event is occurring, any information or expectations from the players must also be included. If an exemption to any rules is required, that must be stated as well.
- The admin(s) holding the event and managing it’s construction are responsible to make sure the event and round are done properly.
- Events must have the approval of a Senior Game Administrator or higher before occurring.
  - Events that change the rules must be approved by a Head Admin
- Actions with do not dramatically affect normal round flow are not considered to be an admin event and do not require authorization.

### Examples of actions which are not an event requiring senior approval
- Forcing a secret game mode before a round has started, so long as the mode being forced is in rotation.
- Triggering a random event within a current round
- Creating a custom antagonist which can operate within normal antagonist conduct and does not alter the normal flow of a round for others

## Antagonist Tokens
- Antagonist tokens are granted only in two rare circumstances.**
  - When the player's antagonist round is inappropriately affected by an Administrator's interference.
  - Admins may grant the token at the direction of the Head Administrators.
- Antagonist tokens may not be traded.
- Token redemptions must take place in the lobby, tokens cannot be redeemed once a player has entered the round.

### Redeemable Antagonist Roles
- Traitor
- Thief
- Ninja
- Sentient Station Pet or Monkey (act as an antagonist if you wish)

**Antagonist token may only be redeemed for the following roles if the same role is not already present in the ongoing round. The exact reasoning for the denial should be withheld to prevent meta-gaming.**
- Space Dragon
- Wizard
- Lone Operative (Should not be spawned if there are currently Nuclear Operatives.)

**Admins have discretion over when antagonist tokens can be redeemed; if the round is too chaotic, they can defer redemption to another round. The exact reasoning for deferral should be kept vague to prevent players from guessing which antagonists are present in the round.**

## Legal and Operations Policy
### Sensitive Information (Restricted Channel Contents)
- The contents of administrative/staff channels is protected, and should not be released without the express authorization of relevant project leadership and consent of all parties involved.
- Game Logs may only be provided after sufficient sanitization, including the removal of Personal Information.
- Game Logs may only be provided for official purposes.

### Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- This includes information such as Hardware Identifiers, IP Addresses, as well as other sensitive identifying information.
- Player data must NEVER be released without express consent of the Head Administrators.
- Staff is prohibited from requesting IDs, photos, or any other directly identifiable information; even for the purposes of age verification.
- Malicious use of data will result in immediate, irrevocable, ejection from the community and possible legal action.
